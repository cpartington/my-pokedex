      <h1>A failed breeding attempt</h1>

      <p>With a great-quality Dragapult and a great-quality Ditto, I was ready to breed a perfect Dreepy. I had high hopes for success since my Ditto was also foreign. I thought I could get an amazing-quality Dreepy in maybe a couple tries.</p>

      <p>Well, I was quickly disappointed. My first egg hatched into a Dreepy that was good, and the next two were only okay. What was going on? Where was the magic? How did people do this for a hundred eggs? Heck, some people did it for a thousand or more. I certaintly don&rsquo;t have the patience for that.</p>

      <p>Very quickly, my motivation died. Looks like I wasn&rsquo;t ready to walk down the long and tedious road after all. I decided to just level up the Dragapult I already had. The big question remaining now was what made this pokémon so great in the first place. It fainted in a single hit from one of Leon&rsquo;s pokémon and didn&rsquo;t seem to be particularly strong.</p>

      <p>My brother said I should stick to the stack that he recommended in the beginning. Maybe he was right.</p>
