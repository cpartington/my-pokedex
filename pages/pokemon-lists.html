    <h1>Chuffin&rsquo;s Pokémon Lists: Sword &amp; Shield</h1>
    <p>This page is still a work in progress, so check back later for updates!</p>
    
    <h2>Current Team</h2>
    <p>Most of my pokémon knowledge has been provided by my brother. This is my current lineup:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Cinderace</em>. My starter pokémon with improved stats via breeding. I guess he's cute enough.</li>
      <li><em>Rhyperior</em>. He&rsquo;s pretty useful, but not very cute.</li>
      <li><em>Dracovish</em>. Pretty ugly pokémon but he does the job. I used to use Gastrodon which is way cuter.</li>
      <li><em>Gourgeist</em>. Of course my brother makes fun of this pokémon but she&rsquo;s quite cute. And pretty useful, especially against Drednaw.</li>
      <li><em>Zacian</em>. I have the sword edition so this is my go-to for fairy pokémon (although far from the cutest one).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Others Under Consideration</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the other pokémon I&rsquo;ve used in the past or am considering using in the future:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eternatus</li>
      <li>Gastrodon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favorite Pokémon</h2>
    <p>A list of my favorite pokémon, regardless of stats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Eevee</strong></em> and all its evolutions. Easily my favorite pokémon of all time.</li>
      <li><em>Raichu</em>. He's pretty cute and less overrated than Pikachu.</li>
      <li><em>Ponyta</em> (Galarian). So heckin cute.</li>
      <li><em>Liepard</em>. Very pretty! Evolves from Purrloin which is also cute.</li>
      <li><em>Yamper</em>. Heckin doge, much cute. And its evolution, Boltund, is very useful.</li>
      <li><em>Vulpix</em>. So cute and pretty!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cutest Pokémon</h2>
    <p>See <a href='cute-pokemon.html'>this page</a> for pictures of the cutest pokémon in Sword &amp; Shield.</p>

    <h2>Ugliest Pokémon</h2>
    <p>
        I hate ugly pokémon. If I could have a powerful team of all Eevee evolutions I would do it in a second. But 
        apparently they&rsquo;re not that good. In the future I&rsquo;ll add a list of the most ugly Sword &amp; Shield 
        pokémon.
