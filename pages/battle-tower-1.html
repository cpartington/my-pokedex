      <h1>First trip to the Battle Tower</h1>

      <p>With the recent acquisition of a Drakloak, it was time to figure out what this Battle Tower thing was. After some intense googling, I knew that the Battle Tower could unlock an IV checker once I made it to a certain level. Before that point, however, I&rsquo;d have to beat Leon, the former champion, again.</p>

      <p>My battles started off well, but it took me a couple days to progress. Battles are nothing new, so I got bored fast. I did get to see some new pokémon that are now on my pokémon wishlist.</p>

      <p>The moment of reckoning came when I was unprepared. I was trying out a stack I&rsquo;d never used&mdash;and it proved to be terrible. One was Boltund, who is usually an excellent party member. Another was Zacian, who was generally successful. Third was probably Rhyperion. Fourth was a temporary replacement from Cinderace, my evolved starter pokémon. Last, I was using Dragapult, my evolved male Drakloak.</p>

      <p>Some of these could be wrong. All I remember is getting trashed by Leon and barely holding on. Dragapult fainted in one hit and none of my pokémon were particularly effective against his pokémon. It was an embarrassment. Fortunately, I still won, but I need to figure out a better party composition.</p>

      <p>With Leon defeated, I achieved my goal. I unlocked the IV checker. Now I could see which of my Drakloaks had the best stats. There was only one problem&mdash;I had no idea how to use it.</p>

      <p>One youtube video later, I was ready. I navigated to my list of pokémon and checked their stats. There were some ups and downs in this process. I discovered that the Drakloak I evolved happened to have the best stats of the three, at an overall level of &ldquo;great.&rdquo; My Boltund only had good stats, which was dissapointing since he was the first pokémon I got to level 100.</p>

      <p>Now that I knew which of my pokémon were strong, it was time to try my hand at breeding high-quality eggs.</p>
