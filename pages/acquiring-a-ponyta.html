      <h1>Acquiring a Ponyta, plus some more</h1>

      <p>After desperately searching for a Pokémon Shield player who could trade me a Ponyta, I resigned myself to the depressing fact that I&rsquo;d never get one. I almost regretted choosing Sword over Shield&mdash;while Zacian is certainly a cuter legendary than Zamazenta, Ponyta exists exclusively in the Shield game, leaving me with an ugly fighting bird.</p>

      <p>I thought briefly about buying Pokémon Shield, but that would be a frivolous use of my money. I considered begging random people on the Internet to trade with me, but I was too distrustful to follow through. After hours of anxious ruminating, I decided to give up. Maybe I&rsquo;d just never see one.</p>

      <p>And then, one day, everything changed. One of my good friends mentioned that his brother had Pokémon Shield and then arranged for his brother to stop by our apartment. I was ecstatic. When the moment of truth arrived, we traded several pokémon and I finally had a Ponyta.</p>

      <p>Even more exciting was that his brother set his language to French, resulting in the pokémon I recieved from him being foreign pokémon. Apparently this has many benefits, including better breeding and better chances of shiny pokémon. If I ever chose to walk down the shiny road, I&rsquo;d have slightly less terrible odds.</p>
