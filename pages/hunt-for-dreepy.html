      <h1>The less-long hunt for Dreepy</h1>

      <p>It was a foggy day and I was on the hunt for an elusive pokémon the Internet claimed to be good. Before this, I halfheartedly ran around in the grass for several days hoping to come across a Dreepy. The Internet said there was a 1&percnt; chance any given day, but today was a foggy day, which meant there was a 2&percnt; chance.</p>

      <p>Today was the day. I started searching, running into several Corviknights. And then I saw it, a strange-looking pokémon with Dreepy on its head. Could this be the mysterious Drakloak I&rsquo;d heard about?</p>

      <p>When I got closer, there were three of them. You can bet I caught all of them. (There was a fourth one that ended up being a casualty.) I couldn&rsquo;t believe my luck. I had one male and two females.</p>

      <p>I really wanted to evolve one of them into Dragapult, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell which one was the best. I&rsquo;d heard of EVs and IVs before, but I had no idea what they were. Thus began my search to find out how good my pokémon were.</p>
